# JSON-Web-Tokens-Nodejs-Mongodb-y-async-await

# Installation

npm i
npm run build
npm start

is a practical example of Json Web tokens using nodejs, Mongodb, and other Javascript technologies. Also use libraries like bcrypt and async / await
I can make requests for a user to register and generate a token to add a security layer in the same way, the initial password is also registered
to make requests I was using the postman
